The Tower is surrounded by a maze (created by *Wish*es) and just beyond the maze was a town. A kind barkeep in an inn (where we stayed that night) warned us not to go in.
Naturally, we entered the maze the following morning, where the [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^bcd3f9\|defector]] hailed us from the tower claiming that the Cult had discovered we were in town the previous day and so he had taken the *mask* and would soon be discovered. He waved a blue object, that could be the *mask* given the distance, and said he would head to a dungeon *?* via a teleporting white glimmering hourglass. He was then found on the balcony and used the hourglass to teleport after stabbing his discoverer with a dagger and pushing them from that balcony.
The maze, which revolved around a puzzle with a sundial and eight paths, took a whole day to best and included various challenges which rewarded gemstones. 
Panel with various symbols {chair (outside), two chairs (barracks), upside down L, right triangle, rectangle, flame, hourglass, star, square...} beside a teleportation circle.
Hannibal, Erevan and Mares found a room with important gloves *?* and the hourglass key.
We fought several cultists there and were able to recover the hourglass teleportation key.


This is where the party [[Tyranny of Dragons/Left off\|left off]].
