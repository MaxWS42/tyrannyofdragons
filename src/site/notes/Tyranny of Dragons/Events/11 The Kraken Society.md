Having returned to the Council, we learnt from [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^f9d438\|Nothinnel]] that *The Kraken Society* has been revived, signalling a potential return of this abhorrent threat.
However, we resolved to send others to Triton to perform a preliminary investigation there about the Kraken Society so that we can deal with the Draakhorn before heading there ourselves as needed. 

We negotiated with the Council to keep Skyreach Castle for the sake of expedience while travelling after [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^476bbd\|Maccath the Crimson]] to [[Tyranny of Dragons/Events/12 The Sea of Moving Ice\|The Sea of Moving Ice]] to rescue her and her expertise from her doomed mission to the North after the Draakhorn's sounding. We left to follow her 4 days after her daily *sending* spell reports ended and her ship was found adrift and with multiple large punctures. She reported seeing ice hunters paddling boats towards a cake-shaped ice berg and we suspected she may have followed them.

After the meeting, [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^7ee353\|Erevan]] followed [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^f9d438\|Nothinnel]] out of the meeting as a wild-shaped fly as we were vaguely suspicious of him. He made a sort of prayer in a private room to avenge two people, while holding a piece of paper.

Finally, we negotiated with the Council to hire two proficient individuals representing factions other than our own to have on Skyreach. We went through extensive interviews with [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^6190e1\|Ontharr]] and finally recruited [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^438771\|Lance Bottomley]] and [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^ae8822\|Zog]].
