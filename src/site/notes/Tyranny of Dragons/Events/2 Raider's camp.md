We followed the raiders north to a camp, and infiltrated that camp in order to find [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^417533\|Leosin]], who we found tied to a post in front of a cave entrance.
The camp was filled with the spoils and loot of the Cult's pillaging, being prepared for travel northwards.
We entered the cave at the camp into a dragon hatchery and, after fighting a roper, stole a black dragon egg ([[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^3b289e\|Twinkletoes the Star Devourer]]).
The party then returned to Greenest and continued on towards [[Tyranny of Dragons/Events/3 Elturel & factions\|Elturel]] at [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^e1a170\|Governor Nighthill's]] suggestion.
