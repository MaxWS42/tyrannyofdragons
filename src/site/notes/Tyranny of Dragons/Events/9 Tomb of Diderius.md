When we arrived at Boorskir Bridge, near we quickly found out about a dwarf who had passed through before us when we found accommodation at Bolo's tentside inn. The [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^bd2adc\|dwarf]] had protected the inn from a dangerous lizardfolk, then left with about a dozen hooded and rough companions towards the mountains.
While following them into the foothills the next day, we came upon an old shrine at which [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^25dc02\|Hannibal]] encountered some kind of horrific entity beyond understanding (with some relation to inkiness, tentacles, whirlpools, a salty smell etc.)
We then came upon a few-day-old campsite, reassuring us that we were on the right path. Finally, we arrived at a ruined old quarry town, that had been abandoned for centuries and was now mere foundations and vague structures.

We then came into the Tomb of Diderius and were asked if we would choose the path of knowledge or of wisdom, and chose the path of wisdom. Inside the dungeon we came across a mosaic of a chimera, beside a well room marked 'SAFE' in chalk. Later, a boulder trap chased us down and we proceeded through various rooms, including a throne room, a library (where [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^54649d\|Kell]] gave a childish ghost, who seemed to be the library's caretaker, a book), a dining room with several bearded devils (what remained of the group led by [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^bd2adc\|Varram]]) who were only interested in anyone leaving the adjacent room and were otherwise unproblematic. 
When we finally found the divination pool, we found a cultist killed by a dagger beside the pool and each received a haunting prophetic vision: Kell was addressed as 'one whose name is always out of teach' and was warned to 'beware the betrayal.' We then continued into Diderius' crypt, and he graciously offered the secret door into the Yuan-ti's lair for us.
We finally battled our way through the Yuan-ti's complex and arrived at a temple of sorts, where we found [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^bd2adc\|Varram]] and brokered a deal with the Yuan-ti for his capture and learnt that the *white dragon mask* was with a dragonborn in a tribal village in the East *?*
[[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^da3f41\|Talis]] contacted us and opened a portal to the [[Tyranny of Dragons/Events/10 Old White Death\|hunting lodge]] so that we would bring [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^bd2adc\|Varram]] to her for questioning.
