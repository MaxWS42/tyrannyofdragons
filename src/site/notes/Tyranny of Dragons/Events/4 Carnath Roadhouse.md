We then continued travelling with some raiders northwards, to uncover the purpose of the caravan. Two important figures separately joined the caravan at Daggerford, one of whom was a Red Wizard, [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^0316fe\|Jos]].

Having arrived at Carnath Roadhouse, we stole and hid the cultists' treasure. A large group of cultists came to collect the treasure and retaliated for its disappearance by invading the roadhouse. Through the death of [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^8864be\|Bog]] and our combined valiant defence, we fought them off and followed those fleeing into the [[Tyranny of Dragons/Events/5 Castle Naerytar\|Mere of Dead Men]].
