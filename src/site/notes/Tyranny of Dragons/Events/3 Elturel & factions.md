We met [[Tyranny of Dragons/People#^6190e1\|Ontharr Frume]] and other representatives of the major factions in Elturel.
Most party members joined a faction that represents their interests, e.g. Kell joined the Harpers and Hannibal joined the Order of the Gauntlet.
We then continued northwards undercover with the Cult's freight caravan towards [[Tyranny of Dragons/Events/4 Carnath Roadhouse\|Carnath Roadhouse]].
