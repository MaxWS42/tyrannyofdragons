We then tracked the cultists into the Mere of Dead Men. Having come upon a small camp with canoes, we met [[People#^70b780\|Snapjaw]] and learned about the Cult's occupation of the Castle with its bullywug allies, and that the lizardfolk were being paid for their labour in metal tools.
Once within Castle Naerytar ([[Castle Naerytar Ground Level.jpg|ground]], [[Castle Naerytar Level 2.jpg|level 2]], [[Castle Naerytar Level 3.jpg|level 3]]), we incited a lizardfolk rebellion (with Snapjaw's help) to overthrow the tyrannous cult and killed Rezmir (for the first time...). We also encountered and killed [[People#^0316fe\|Jos]] *?* in a tower.

We also learnt the progression of cult ranks, that is, from dragonclaw, dragonwing, dragonfang, dragonsoul to wyrmspeaker.

In Castle Naerytar, we then proceeded through an [[Castle Naerytar Dungeon.jpg|underground area]] and found a portal, that took us to a [[Events/6 Hunting Lodge\|hunting lodge]] in the Graypeak Mountains.
