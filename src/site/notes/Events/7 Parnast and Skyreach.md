We passed _rapidly_ through the town of Parnast and immediately crossed the drawbridge into Skyreach Castle itself through the use of a strategic [[People#^290b3b\|quetzalcoatlus]].
Once aboard, we purported as the High & Mighty Inquisition of the Dragon and took charge of Skyreach after killing [[People#^bc51ec\|Sandesyl]] and [[People#^b1fe06\|Rezmir]] (again). Before killing Sandesyl, we learnt that *dracoliches* were the original goal of the cult and that Severin had a new objective in mind: the summoning of Tiamat to the Material Plane, with which [[People#^bc51ec\|Sandesyl]] disagreed.
We ruthlessly silenced Marcus (guard accused of the murder of Rezmir).

There were 5 [[People#^c1780f\|dragonsouls]] aboard Skyreach (led by Sirathis and Rezmir) which each commanded 3 dragonfangs who in turn managed a grunt mass of dragonwings and dragonfangs.

Our first formal meeting with the Council of Waterdeep was about Skyreach Castle. We came to the Council seeking troops to help clear the cult's forces off the flying castle. The results around the table were:
	[[People#^3cab73\|Lord Neverember]] (sat at the head of the table, beside [[People\|People]]) pledged 150 men from Waterdeep
	[[People#^1fef34\|Marshal Ulder Ravengard]] pledged 20 Flaming Fists
	[[People#^a00831\|Connerad Brawnanvil]] pledged 50 dwarf soldiers
	[[People#^a72d4f\|King Melandrach]] offered no support
	[[People#^95c41e\|Wizzleby Burrowtail]] proffered himself and the knowledge that can be found in Candlekeep
	[[People#^ec7f16\|Remallia Haventree]] pledged 50 (Harper) spies
	[[People#^6190e1\|Ontharr Frume]] pledged us 100 men
	The Zhentarim representative (some black veil wearer) offered no support

With our new-found troops, we performed a red feast (including a *scroll of incendiary cloud)* to clear the cult's troops out. We then returned to the [[Events/8 Council of Waterdeep\|Council]].
