We returned to the lodge and decided that it was at last time to free ourselves of [[People#^da3f41\|Talis]], when she took [[People#^bd2adc\|Varram]] into her custody against our plans to bring him before the Council.

We slew [[People#^bd2adc\|Varram]] and his dragon, Old White Death, dramatically and with the assistance of dropping a literal t-rex on the dragon, after it had used a flurry of melee attacks to down [[People#^54649d\|Kell]].
[[People#^25dc02\|Hannibal]] at first faced [[People#^da3f41\|Talis]] alone, and was asked about *her* dragon, Glazhael (from Skyreach). After a surprising deception with a letter, he was eventually joined by the rest of the party, whence she too was killed.

Having killed both, we were effectively stranded in the Gray Peak mountains, without any means to return to the Council of Waterdeep and report on our mission. [[People#^c9d0af\|Mares]] communed with his patron, who generously sent a group of metallic dragons to carry us to civilisation. He warned that His interference may bring more direct involvement from Tiamat, and we encountered this as we neared a major road. He gave a further warning of a stirring in the deep, speaking about a truly horrific force beyond anything we currently understand, with tendrils everywhere.

An enormous, scarred pit fiend burst through said road, leaving a huge rift, and the metallic dragons dismounted us and scattered. We had another epic battle and eventually returned its body deep into the rift. 
Approaching us once we had killed the pit fiend was a lavishly dressed triton, who introduced himself as [[People#^f9d438\|Nothinnel]], an emissary headed to the Council. We helped him continue and guarded him along the onward journey back to Waterdeep, where we came back to the [[Events/11 The Kraken Society\|Council]].
