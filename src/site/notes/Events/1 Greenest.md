The party saved Greenest from a [[People#^621cb2\|blue dragon]] and a Cult of the Dragon raiding party.
We then had a discussion with [[People#^e1a170\|Governor Tarbaw Nighthill]] about rewards and our plans. He asked us to rescue a monk, [[People#^417533\|Leosin Erlanthar]], who was kidnapped by the raiders and being taken to the [[Events/2 Raider's camp\|raiders' camp]].
