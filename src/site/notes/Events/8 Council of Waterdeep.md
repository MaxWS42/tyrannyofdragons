The draakhorn sounded.

Having returned to the Council with Skyreach successfully cleared, we discussed our next course of action: either hunting down the draakhorn that gathers the chromatic dragons or hunting down the white wyrmspeaker, [[People#^bd2adc\|Varram]].
We chose to first hunt down Varram, who we believed had lost his dragon mask and set out to the [[Events/9 Tomb of Diderius\|Tomb of Diderius]] to somehow recover it.
