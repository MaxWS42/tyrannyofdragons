Once we arrived at the hunting lodge, we were found by [[People#^60a3db\|Trepsin]] and attempted to go undercover as new cult members sent North. 
We then encountered [[People#^da3f41\|Talis]], who used invisible animated armour *?* to terrorise us while we were snooping around the lodge. She offered us safe passage and information about the Cult if we agreed to weakening [[People#^b1fe06\|Rezmir]]'s cause, and so sent us on to [[Events/7 Parnast and Skyreach\|Skyreach Castle]].
